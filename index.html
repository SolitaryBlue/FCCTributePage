    <blockquote>
    <h2>Timeline of Chris Cornell's life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cornell was born Christopher John Boyle on July 20, 1964, in Seattle, Washington, where he was raised.</li>
      <li>In the early 1980s, Cornell was a member of a cover band called The Shemps, which featured bassist Hiro Yamamoto and performed around Seattle. After Yamamoto left The Shemps, the band recruited guitarist Kim Thayil. Cornell and Yamamoto stayed in contact, and after The Shemps broke up, the pair started jamming together, eventually bringing Thayil in to join them.</li>
      <li>Soundgarden was formed in 1984 by Cornell, Thayil and Yamamoto with Cornell originally on drums and vocals. In 1985, the band enlisted Scott Sundquist as the drummer to allow Cornell to concentrate on vocals. The band's first recordings were three songs that appeared on a compilation for C/Z Records called <em>Deep Six.</em></li>      
      <li>In 1986, Scott Sundquist, who by that point had a wife and a child, decided to leave the band and spend time with his family. He was replaced by Matt Cameron, the drummer for Skin Yard, who became Soundgarden's permanent drummer.</li>
      <li>Though the band was being courted by major labels, they signed to independent label SST Records in 1988 to release their debut album, <em>Ultramega OK</em>, for which they earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990. The band subsequently signed with A&M Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign to a major label. Along with Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden quickly became one of the most successful bands from Seattle's emerging grunge scene in the early 1990s.</li>
      <li>The band's fourth studio album, 1994's <em>Superunknown</em>, proved to be the band's breakthrough album. Upon its release in March 1994, <em>Superunknown</em> debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.The album launched several successful singles, including "Spoonman" and "Black Hole Sun", and brought Soundgarden international recognition. <em>Superunknown</em> achieved quintuple platinum status in the United States, triple platinum status in Canada, and gold status in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the Netherlands.</li>
      <li>In 1997, Soundgarden received another Grammy nomination, for the lead single "Pretty Noose". As tensions grew within the band, reportedly due to internal strife over its creative direction, Soundgarden announced it was disbanding on April 9, 1997.</li>
      <li>In 1998, Cornell began working on material for a solo album on which he collaborated with Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider of the band Eleven. The album, titled <em>Euphoria Morning</em>, was released on September 21, 1999. The album was re-released in 2015 on CD and vinyl and retitled <em>Euphoria Mourning</em>, with Cornell stating in the press release that he had originally intended the album to be called that, but his manager at the time, Jim Guerinot, suggested that "Euphoria Morning" without the "u" would be a better title.</li>
      <li>Audioslave was formed after Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine and the remaining members were searching for another vocalist. Producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they contact Cornell. Their debut album, <em>Audioslave</em>, released in November 2002, spawned hits such as "Cochise," "Like a Stone," and "Show Me How to Live," and reached triple platinum status in the United States. All of Audioslave's lyrics were written by Cornell, while all four members were credited with writing the music.</li>
      <li>While still in Soundgarden, Cornell recorded an album with members of what would become Pearl Jam. This collaboration went under the name Temple of the Dog, and the self-titled album was released in 1991. The album is a tribute to their mutual friend Andrew Wood, the former lead singer of Mother Love Bone, who had died of a heroin overdose the year before. </li>
      <li>In 2012, Cornell and his wife created the <a href="http://chrisandvickycornellfoundation.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Chris and Vicky Cornell Foundation</a>, which works for homeless, poor, abused or neglected children.
<li>Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room at the MGM Grand in Detroit on May 18, 2017. The cause of his death was determined to be suicide by hanging. He was 52 years old.</li>
